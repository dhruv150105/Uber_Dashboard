# Uber_Dashboard


This repository contains the complete Power BI project for analyzing ride-booking data for the NCR region. The goal of this project was to take raw transactional data, clean it, build an interactive multi-page dashboard, and derive actionable business insights.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into a clean, easy-to-understand folder structure:

### 1_Data: Contains the raw and supplementary data files.

ncr_ride_bookings.csv: The primary transactional data for all rides.

locations.csv: A helper file created to provide accurate latitude and longitude for mapping visuals.

### 2_Report: Contains the final Power BI report file.

NCR Ride Analysis.pbix: The complete Power BI project file with the data model, transformations, and all visuals.

### 3_Analysis_and_Screenshots: Contains the final business report and visual assets.

business_report.md: A detailed report summarizing the key findings and strategic recommendations derived from the dashboard.

dashboard_screenshot.png: A screenshot of the main dashboard page.


# Key Insights Derived from the Dashboard
Peak Demand Identified: Business demand is highest during the months of July-August and on weekends, especially during the evening hours (6 PM - 9 PM).

Cancellation Root Cause Pinpointed: The primary reason for customer cancellations is driver delays, with a significant spike during morning rush hours (9 AM), indicating a critical supply-demand gap.

Geographic "Problem Zones" Flagged: Certain areas like "Gurgaon Sector 56" were identified as having poor operational performance with high driver response times, leading directly to a poor customer experience.

Most Valuable Vehicle Category Uncovered: While "Go Mini" is the most booked vehicle, the "Go Sedan" is the most valuable category, generating higher revenue per ride and better overall customer satisfaction ratings.
